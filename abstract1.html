We study a mathematical model for high Lewis number combustion
processes with the reaction rate&nbsp; of the form of an Arrhenius law
with or without an ignition cut-off.&nbsp; An efficient method for the
proof of&nbsp; the existence and uniqueness of combustion fronts is
provided by geometric singular perturbation theory.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
fronts supported by the model with very large Lewis numbers are small
perturbations of the front&nbsp; supported by the model with in&#64257;nite
Lewis number. <br>
