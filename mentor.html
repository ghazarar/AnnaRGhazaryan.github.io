The goal of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) Mentor
Network is to match mentors, both men and women, with girls and women
who are interested in mathematics or are pursuing careers in
mathematics. The network is intended to link mentors with a variety of
groups: recent PhD's, graduate students, undergraduates, high school
and grade school students, and teachers. Matching is based on common
interests in careers in academics or industry, math education, balance
of career and family, or general mathematical interests. <br>

MENTOR:</span> </font> Volunteer to mentor someone in their pursuit of
their
mathematical interests or to help the AWM Mentor Network in other ways.
As a mentor you don't have to have all of the answers, but you can help
to make the connection to someone or someplace that does! <br>

  <font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"> REQUEST A
MENTOR:</span> </font> Would you like
to find out about opportunities for
math degrees or careers? Do you need some advice as you pursue your
mathematical studies or career? Do you have questions for someone who
has experience and expertise as a mathematician? Then request to be
matched with a mentor from the AWM Mentor Network! <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">HOW TO
JOIN THE AWM MENTOR NETWORK:</span> </font> Just fill out a
form on the AWM <a name="tex2html1"
